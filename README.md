Amazon Polly will use different voices to act out movie scripts you provide

Found a simple movie script parser on this post:

Added a simple Dictionary to set voices, and added Polly capabilities. 

This is nothing fancy but i thought it would be funny to listen to.

#TODO 
- Set a list of voices and auto assign the Polly voices to actors
