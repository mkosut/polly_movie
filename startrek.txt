Beverly stops at a table in front of a shop selling
	exotic materials. The modest selections of cloth are
	lined up on the table, some draped for best effect.
	Beverly looks over them critically, feeling weight and
	texture. The Bandi SHOPKEEPER has stayed at the rear
	of the booth.

					BEVERLY
			"Useful"? How and what,
			Commander?

					RIKER
			Investigating some things I've
			noticed here, Doctor. The last
			was a piece of fruit...

	Beverly has frowned over a particularly pretty piece
	of material which she holds up for the shopkeeper to
	see.

					BEVERLY
			Would this be available in emerald
			green?

	The Bandi Merchant smiles, nods and takes the bolt of
	cloth INTO A SMALL CLOSED OFF AREA BEHIND. Wes watches
	the merchant go as Beverly turns to look at Riker
	appraisingly.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			I'm sure, Commander, there are
			reasons for a first officer to
			want to demonstrate his energy
			and alertness to a new captain.
			But since my duty and interests
			are outside the command
			structure...

	The Bandi Merchant comes quickly with the bolt of cloth
	-- now emerald green -- interrupts Beverly by holding
	it up for her approval.

					RIKER
			Isn't it nice he happened to have
			the right color?

	Beverly glances sharply at Riker, suppressing a somewhat
	chagrined look.

74   CONTINUED: (2)

					BEVERLY
				(to Merchant)
			Thank you. I'll take the entire
			bolt. Charge it to Beverly
			Crusher, Chief Medical Officer,
			USS Enterprise.

	The Merchant nods, ticks the information off on a flat
	little gadget that dangles from his belt, hands her the
	bolt of cloth.

75   ANOTHER ANGLE - DOLLYING WITH BEVERLY, RIKER, WESLEY

	as they walk away, Riker enjoying the look that's come
	onto her face over this incident.

					RIKER
			Let's see, where were we?

					BEVERLY
			I was accusing you of inventing
			work in order to curry favor with
			your new captain. I apologize.

					WESLEY
			Finding the exact right color took
			him only about twelve seconds,
			Mom.

	They stop a little distance off and look back toward
	the shop.

					BEVERLY
			Maybe this is something Jean-Luc
			Picard will want looked into.

					RIKER
			Jean-Luc? You know Captain
			Picard?

					WESLEY
				(proudly)
			When I was little, he brought my
			father's body home to us.

	Riker is startled but Beverly only smiles, fondly pats
	her son's head.

75   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Yes, Wes, long, long ago.
				(to Riker)
			Shall we continue the walk? I'd
			like to know you better, Mister
			Riker.

									CUT TO:

76   INT. FARPOINT LOUNGE - DAY - ON GEORDI AND MARKHAM

	LT. GEORDI LaFORGE and ENSIGN SAWYER MARKHAM are in the
	small, comfortable lounge area. Markham is a likeable
	young man, enthusiastic, energetic. He is still
	inclined to shoot from the hip rather than consider
	before speaking, but he is a capable (and very new)
	graduate of the Academy. We SEE Geordi at first only
	from behind, and we may routinely register the fact he
	is black.

					MARKHAM
			Where is she? They say she's
			never late -- not since the old
			burrhog took over the captain's
			chair.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			You wouldn't be talking about the
			Enterprise, would you, Ensign
			Markham?

77   WIDER ANGLE

	The two young men turn around sharply to find Riker has
	come up behind them. The most important thing we notice
	about Geordi is that he wears a strange flattish device
	(like futuristic goggles) over his eyes. Although he
	is technically blind, his head always turns toward the
	person speaking to him because he can, in fact, see as
	well or better than anyone through the use of the visual
	prosthesis. As they realize that Riker is a senior
	officer, both young men straighten to attention.

					GEORDI/MARKHAM
			Sir. Yes, sir.

	Riker smiles at the ingrained and traditional response
	of the recent Academy graduate.

					RIKER
			You can stand at ease, gentlemen.
			We're not on the Enterprise yet.

77   CONTINUED:

					MARKHAM
			You know we're assigned to her,
			sir.

					RIKER
				(extending his hand)
			Riker. I'm slated to be First
			Officer.
				(they shake hands)
			I read the service records on all
			new personnel on the trip out.
			Excellent academic record at
			Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham.

					MARKHAM
			Thank you, sir.

					RIKER
			And you, Mister LaForge. Captain
			Dreyer praised your performance
			on the Hood. Why did you request
			transfer to the Enterprise?

					GEORDI
			Who wouldn't, sir? The biggest,
			newest, fastest starship in the
			fleet --

					RIKER
			Commanded by the best burrhog in
			the fleet. Right, Mister Markham?

					MARKHAM
				(sheepishly)
			Yes, sir.

					RIKER
				(grins)
			I've already forgotten who used
			those words.

					GEORDI
			Shouldn't we have heard something
			from her by now, sir?

	A BANDI WOMAN approaches:

					BANDI WOMAN
			Commander Riker?

					RIKER
			Yes?

77   CONTINUED: (2)

					BANDI WOMAN
			The Enterprise has been picked
			up on our monitors, sir. I should
			tell you, sir, it is only the
			Stardrive Section.

	All three crewman are surprised to hear this.

					RIKER
				(to Woman)
			What about the Saucer Module?

					BANDI WOMAN
			We've received no explanation,
			sir. But the captain signals that
			you're to beam up immediately.

					GEORDI
				(to Markham)
			Our new captain doesn't waste
			time.

					RIKER
			A good rule for all of us to
			follow, gentlemen.

	Riker touches his communicator. His VOICE now 'treated'
	to indicate he is transmitting. (This will be standard
	communicator format.)

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Enterprise, this is Commander
			Riker on Farpoint. Standing by
			to beam up.

	TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)

									FADE OUT.

                           PART FOUR                            

	FADE IN:

78   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise stardrive module in orbit of the Farpoint
	planet.

0    INT. STARDRIVE TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON PLATFORM (OPTICCAL)

	As Riker BEAMS IN. Lieutenant Tasha Yar of Security
	is there, waiting until Riker is fully materialized,
	then:

					TASHA
			Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.
			Captain Picard will see you on
			the Battle Bridge.

	Riker was prepared to shake hands but Tasha is already
	leading the way toward the turbolift.

80   INT. TURBOLIFT

	As Riker follows her inside, she speaks quietly toward
	the controls:

					TASHA
			Battle bridge.

	The doors snap closed and the lift moves. Riker looks
	Tasha over, waiting, then:

					RIKER
			With the saucer gone, can I assume
			something interesting happened
			on your way here?

					TASHA
			I'll let the captain explain, sir.

81   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

	He is seated in the command chair with Data and
	a couple of other crewpersons at their stations.

					DATA
			We are cleared into the standard
			parking orbit, sir.

81   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Make it so.

	The bridge turbolift doors open, Riker ENTERS the bridge
	after Tasha, follows her to Picard.

					TASHA
			Commander Riker, sir.

					RIKER
			Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered,
			sir.

	Picard takes his time, looking Riker over and then
	offering his hand.

					PICARD
			I really didn't expect to welcome
			you to half a starship, Riker.
				(to Tasha)
			Is the viewer ready?

					TASHA
			All set up, sir.

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			We'll first bring you up to date
			on a little... "adventure" we had
			on our way here, Commander. Then
			we'll talk.

					TASHA
				(to Riker)
			This way, sir.
